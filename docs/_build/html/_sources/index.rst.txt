PyeDNA (“pie-dee-en-ay”) is a Python wrapper library for the C++ EzDnaApi, written for data scientists who wish to work with eDNA data in the context of a pandas DataFrame. By converting eDNA data into a DataFrame, data analysis can be accomplished using familiar tools like scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc. New functions will be added upon request.
